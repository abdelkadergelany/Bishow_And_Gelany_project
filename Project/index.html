            <p>
                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
                control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
                for example: Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by
                supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                (DOM). For example,
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                    HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form
                    input, and page navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                    server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                    another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                    server.

                <li>A general
                    understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li> Good
                    working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the
                    tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. </p>
            <p>The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            </p>
            <p>JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
